c3sPortal README
==================

This is a portal site for the upcoming Creative Commons Collecting Society.

The main virtue of this app and repository is the collection of texts about C3S.

It is both a container and collaboration tool and at the same time serves 
as presentation medium. To reach out as much as possible, it allows for 
internationalization (i18n) of the texts.
