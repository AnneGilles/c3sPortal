#. Default: What is C3S?
#: c3sportal/templates/about.pt:14
msgid "headline-what_is_C3S"
msgstr ""

#. Default: C3S - Creative Commons Collecting Society - is the working title of a
#. project to establish a new European Collecting Society for musical works,
#. especially those works published under a Creative Commons license.
#: c3sportal/templates/about.pt:16
msgid "about-definition-p1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Once officially approved by the German office for patents and brands
#. (Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt) and other relevant institutions in other
#. countries C3S will be a full-fledged alternative comparing to existing
#. collecting societies for musical works. It will be a one-stop-shop for its
#. members when it comes to work-related contracts and accounting and will be able
#. to take over on behalf of the creators when dealing with licensees.
#: c3sportal/templates/about.pt:20
msgid "about-definition-p2"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Support and dissemination of Creative Commons licensing by consulting
#. and workshops, by lectures and public relations is essential to our work. In
#. addition to that, we promote projects in culture which facilitate and support
#. the work of independent as well as young artists in a sustainable way.

#. Default: Formally C3S is a project of OpenMusicContest.org e.V (a non-profit

#. why we decided to choose this path here.
#: c3sportal/templates/about.pt:66
msgid "about-background-p2"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Representing various stakeholders and domains, all individual team
#. members, no matter if supporter or initiator, add their personal view
#. complementing each other. We want to consider and integrate all intentions and
#. skills of those people who all together can help in shaping an improved
#. environment for independent artists. This is essential for establishing a
#. collecting society that embraces digital society - it takes composers and
#. writers, musicians, users, but as well it's lawyers, economists, software
#. developers and netizens who are needed... to name but a few.

msgid "about-background-p4"
msgstr ""

#. Default: No matter who the members of the *construction team* are: When C3S has
#. been founded, according to the statutes only musicians (performers) and
#. composers and writers respectively (creators) can become members of C3S.
#. Supporters of C3S can join a supporting association or be elected into the
#. advisory board of C3S.

#. Default: The Motivation - Why another collecting society?
#: c3sportal/templates/about.pt:143
msgid "headline-about-motivation"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Lack of market integration of Creative Commons licensed works
#: c3sportal/templates/about.pt:150
msgid "about-motivation-market-integration"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Musicians must be able to easily make use of the commercial option of
#. free licenses without passing on advantages for non-commercial usage. Also, they
#. must not depend on commercially available licensing platforms. A collecting
#. society has no economic intentions besides those of its members.
#. Default: Take the download catalogue of Jamendo, and you'll find more than
#. 300,000 titles by almost 40,000 artists. Free Music Archive is offering about
#. 25,000 tracks. In addition, there are various dedicated platforms and
#. aggregators, netlabels and providers of free licensed music - all of them may
#. benefit from C3S.
#. Default: Vimeo for example in cooperation with Free Music Archive offers a
#. library of podcast suitable music. More examples you can find at previously
#. mentioned outlets, but also at content providers such as flickr and YouTube.
#. Moreover, in broadcast increasingly content is made use of and produced that has
#. been licensed under Creative Commons (Link:
#. http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Broadcasting). This can be observed at BBC and
#. Norwegian NRK as well as with German NDR and BR, or Al Jazeera.
#. Default: Creators might want to allow for a free download for personal use. On
#. the other hand, they would like to control licensing and distribution of their
#. works, and they expect to be paid a fee for commercial use. At this moment, it's
#. only providers like Jamendo or rightclearing.com (restorm.com) who are offering
#. that. The other way is to negotiate individual contracts which are uncomfortable
#. for both, the artist as well as the licensee.
#. Default: Fans and listeners of music are not familiar with benefits and concept
#. of Creative Commons - if they know them at all. Moreover, it's often the same
#. with licensees and artists. Even worse, Creative Commons services sometimes are
#. mistaken for being unconditionally free of cost and entirely free of
#. constraints.
