	<p i18n:translate="about-definition-p1">
	  C3S - Creative Commons Collecting Society - is the working title of a project to establish a new European Collecting Society for musical works, especially those works published under a Creative Commons license.
	</p>

	<p i18n:translate="about-definition-p2">
	  Once officially approved by the German office for patents and brands (Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt) and other relevant institutions in other countries C3S will be a full-fledged alternative comparing to existing collecting societies for musical works. It will be a one-stop-shop for its members when it comes to work-related contracts and accounting and will be able to take over on behalf of the creators when dealing with licensees.
	</p>

	<p i18n:translate="about-definition-p3">
	  Support and dissemination of Creative Commons licensing by consulting and workshops, by lectures and public relations is essential to our work. In addition to that, we promote projects in culture which facilitate and support the work of independent as well as young artists in a sustainable way.

	  Formally C3S is a project of OpenMusicContest.org e.V (a non-profit association) in coordination with other independent persons. You can read up on why we decided to choose this path here.

	  Representing various stakeholders and domains, all individual team members, no matter if supporter or initiator, add their personal view complementing each other. We want to consider and integrate all intentions and skills of those people who all together can help in shaping an improved environment for independent artists. This is essential for establishing a collecting society that embraces digital society - it takes composers and writers, musicians, users, but as well it's lawyers, economists, software developers and netizens who are needed... to name but a few.

We are looking forward to hearing from you!

	<p i18n:translate="about-background-p5">
	  No matter who the members of the *construction team* are: When C3S has been founded, according to the statutes only musicians (performers) and composers and writers respectively (creators) can become members of C3S. Supporters of C3S can join a supporting association or be elected into the advisory board of C3S.

	  Take the download catalogue of Jamendo, and you'll find more than 300,000 titles by almost 40,000 artists. Free Music Archive is offering about 25,000 tracks. In addition, there are various dedicated platforms and aggregators, netlabels and providers of free licensed music - all of them may benefit from C3S.

	  Vimeo for example in cooperation with Free Music Archive offers a library of podcast suitable music. More examples you can find at previously mentioned outlets, but also at content providers such as flickr and YouTube. Moreover, in broadcast increasingly content is made use of and produced that has been licensed under Creative Commons (Link: http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Broadcasting). This can be observed at BBC and Norwegian NRK as well as with German NDR and BR, or Al Jazeera.

        <p i18n:translate="about-motivation-p1">
	  Creators might want to allow for a free download for personal use. On the other hand, they would like to control licensing and distribution of their works, and they expect to be paid a fee for commercial use. At this moment, it's only providers like Jamendo or rightclearing.com (restorm.com) who are offering that. The other way is to negotiate individual contracts which are uncomfortable for both, the artist as well as the licensee.

        <p i18n:translate="about-motivation-p1">
	  Fans and listeners of music are not familiar with benefits and concept of Creative Commons - if they know them at all. Moreover, it's often the same with licensees and artists. Even worse, Creative Commons services sometimes are mistaken for being unconditionally free of cost and entirely free of constraints.
